# Security Incident Resolution - January 8, 2025

## Incident Summary
- **Date**: January 8, 2025
- **Issue**: Shopify API credentials exposed in GitHub repository
- **File**: `database-export-2025-07-31T12-48-06-004Z.json`
- **Shopify Ticket**: 8fb311a5-ea1d-47fc-96a7-abd918afc08e

## Exposed Credentials (Now Revoked)
- Store access tokens for:
  - rajeshshah.myshopify.com: `shpua_a3cb5421464bdfad1969f818e83d41a3`
  - reviewtesting434.myshopify.com: `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`

## Immediate Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ 1. File Removal (Completed)
- Removed dangerous database export file containing exposed credentials
- File permanently deleted from local environment

### ‚úÖ 2. Enhanced .gitignore Security (Completed)
- Added comprehensive patterns to prevent future credential exposure:
  - `database-export-*`
  - `*.json` (database exports)
  - `credentials.*`
  - `secrets.*`
  - `.env`
  - `access_tokens.*`
  - `api_keys.*`

### ‚úÖ 3. Secure Environment Configuration (Completed)
- Configured secure environment variables in Replit:
  - `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` (new rotated credentials)
  - `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` (new rotated credentials)
  - `SHOPIFY_APP_URL`
- All credentials now stored securely, never in code

## Required User Actions

1. **Rotate Shopify App Credentials**
   - ‚úÖ Generated new API credentials in Shopify Partner Dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Updated environment variables in Replit

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### ‚úÖ Code Security
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent credential commits
- Environment variables properly configured
- Database exports blocked from repository

### ‚úÖ Development Practices
- All API credentials moved to secure environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Secure credential handling documented

## Verification

### ‚úÖ Environment Security Check
- All required secrets properly configured
- Application successfully connecting with new credentials
- No exposed credentials in codebase

### ‚úÖ Application Status

2. **User must respond to Shopify governance email**
3. Monitor for any suspicious activity on affected stores
4. Continue with normal development operations

## Lessons Learned

- Never export database files containing credentials
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regular security audits of repository contents
- Comprehensive .gitignore patterns essential
