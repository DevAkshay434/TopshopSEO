# TopShop SEO - Shopify Blog Content Generation App

## Overview

TopShop SEO is a comprehensive Shopify application that automates blog content generation and SEO optimization for e-commerce stores. The application uses AI services (Claude, OpenAI) to generate high-quality blog posts, manages their publication scheduling, and provides analytics on content performance. The system supports both embedded Shopify admin functionality and standalone operation.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript

- **AI Services**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI (with template fallbacks)
- **External APIs**: Shopify Admin API, Pexels, DataForSEO, HuggingFace
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend bundling, ESBuild for backend

### Architecture Pattern
The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: React SPA communicating with Express REST API
- **Multi-tenant Design**: Supports multiple Shopify stores per installation
- **Embedded App Support**: Functions both as standalone app and Shopify Admin embedded app
- **Microservice-oriented**: Modular services for AI content generation, media management, and Shopify integration

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture

- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI component library with custom styling
- **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS with mobile-first approach
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Backend Services
- **Authentication**: Shopify OAuth 2.0 flow with multi-store support
- **Content Generation**: AI-powered blog post creation with multiple providers

### Database Schema
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Separate stores with user-store relationships
- **Content Management**: Blog posts, templates, and generation requests
- **User Management**: Authors, permissions, and store access control
- **Analytics**: Sync activities and content performance metrics

## Data Flow

### Content Generation Flow
1. User selects topic/template or provides custom prompt
2. AI service (Claude/OpenAI) generates content based on parameters
3. Content is processed and formatted with SEO optimization
4. User reviews and customizes generated content
5. Content is published immediately or scheduled for future publication
6. Analytics tracking begins upon publication

### Shopify Integration Flow
1. OAuth authentication establishes store connection
2. Store data (blogs, products, collections) is synchronized
3. Content is published via Shopify Admin API
4. Media assets are managed through Shopify Files API
5. Performance data is collected and analyzed

### Multi-Store Management
1. Users can connect multiple Shopify stores
2. Each store maintains separate content and settings
3. Billing and permissions are managed per store
4. Content can be generated independently for each store

## External Dependencies

### AI Content Generation
- **Primary**: Anthropic Claude API (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
- **Secondary**: OpenAI API for content generation
- **Fallback**: Template-based content generation system

### Media Services

- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

### Production Deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, ESBuild bundles backend
- **Autoscale Deployment**: Configured for automatic scaling
- **Health Checks**: Port 5000 monitoring for application health
- **Static Assets**: Served from dist/public directory

### Security Considerations
