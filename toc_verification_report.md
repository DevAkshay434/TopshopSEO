## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Status

### Functions Working in Production:
1. **`addHeadingIds(content)`** - Automatically adds id attributes to H2 headings
2. **`addTableOfContents(processedContent)`** - Generates TOC with proper same-page navigation
3. **Content Processing Pipeline** - Lines 729-731 in claude.ts:
   ```typescript
   let processedContent = removeH1Tags(jsonContent.content);
   processedContent = addTableOfContents(processedContent);
   processedContent = processMediaPlacementsHandler(processedContent, request);
   ```

### Verification Method:
