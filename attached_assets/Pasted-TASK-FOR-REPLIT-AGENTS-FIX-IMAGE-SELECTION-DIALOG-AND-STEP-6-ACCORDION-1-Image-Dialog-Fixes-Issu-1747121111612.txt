TASK FOR REPLIT AGENTS: FIX IMAGE SELECTION DIALOG AND STEP 6 ACCORDION
1. Image Dialog Fixes
Issue:

The image selection popup loads images, but users cannot see or select them.

Another element (layout structure) is covering or blocking the image view.

Clicking images does not always register the selection due to a glitch in the interaction logic.

Required Fixes:

Update CSS stacking context to ensure images are visible on top of all other elements inside the modal.

Fix layout and positioning to remove or push any blocking elements below the image layer.

Add a visual indication (such as a border or checkmark) to confirm when an image is selected.

Resolve any issues with event listeners or DOM interference that block the image selection click.

Expected Outcome:

All images are clearly visible and selectable by users inside the popup.

Visual feedback appears instantly when a user selects one or more images.

Selection events work consistently without glitch or delay.

2. Step 6 Fixes â€“ Content Cluster Accordion
Issue:

In Step 6, the cluster content is not rendering correctly.

There are errors when generating or displaying accordion views for multiple articles.

Current UI lacks structure for organized article preview and editing.

Required Structure:

Each cluster should be displayed in an accordion format. For each article:

Accordion Title: Use the article title.

Accordion Content: Include two tabs:

Preview Tab:

Show the full article content.

Display featured image and inline content images, linked to relevant product(s).

Show all standard formatting: H1, H2, table of contents, FAQ sections, etc.

Edit Tab:

Show a WYSIWYG or markdown editor with the full article content, allowing in-place editing.

Accordion Footer Buttons:

Save as Draft to Shopify

Publish to Shopify

Schedule for Publish Later

Technical Requirements:

The accordion should support multiple open states simultaneously.

Each accordion item must independently switch between Preview and Edit tabs.

Handle rendering errors gracefully with user-friendly fallback or retry options.

All footer buttons must correctly trigger Shopify-related backend actions.
