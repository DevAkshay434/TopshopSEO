I want to add a “Create and Save Project” feature to my Shopify app’s admin panel. Here’s the detailed plan:

---

### OBJECTIVE:
Allow users to create named content projects that store the full form state (product selections, formatting options, media, etc.) so they can reload and continue working without re-entering data.

---

### FRONTEND FEATURES:

1. **Create New Project**
- Button: "Create New Project"
- Shows popup with:
  - Project Name (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - "Create Project" button

2. **Load Saved Projects**
- Button: "Load Saved Project"
- Shows dropdown/modal of user’s saved projects
- Loads selected project and auto-fills admin form

3. **Save Project**
- Button at bottom of admin form labeled “Save Project”
- When clicked:
  - Validates if a project is open
  - Saves current form state to DB under that project

4. **Form Autofill**
- When loading a project:
  - All fields listed below are auto-filled
  - All fields remain editable

---

### FORM FIELDS TO TRACK:

- selectedProducts
- selectedCollections
- buyerPersonas
- selectedKeywords
- selectedTitle
- mediaContent:
  - primaryImage
  - secondaryImages
  - youtubeEmbed
- selectedAuthorId
- articleLength
- headingsCount
- writingPerspective
- toneOfVoice
- contentStyle
- introType
- faqType
- categories
- postStatus
- publicationType

---

### BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:

- DB Table: `projects` with:
  - id, name, description, userId, createdAt, lastUpdated
  - `projectData` field (JSON) for storing form state

- API Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/projects` → Create project
  - `PUT /api/projects/:id` → Update project
  - `GET /api/projects/:id` → Load project
  - `GET /api/projects` → List user’s projects

---

### EXTRA NOTES:
- Make sure project is only saved when user clicks “Save Project” button.
- Project auto-fill logic must be safe and not override user edits unless loading a new project.
- Form should still work even if no project is active (i.e., manual entry still allowed).
