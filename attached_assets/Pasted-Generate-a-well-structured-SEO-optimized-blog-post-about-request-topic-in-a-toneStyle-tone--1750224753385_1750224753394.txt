    - Use proper link formatting: <a href="URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">descriptive anchor text</a>
    - Make anchor text descriptive and specific (e.g., "EPA water quality standards" not "click here")
    - Distribute links across different sections of the content for better SEO value
    - Links should enhance credibility and provide readers with additional authoritative information
    - When mentioning statistics, studies, or facts, link to the authoritative source when possible

    - Selected YouTube video MUST be placed under the SECOND H2 heading only
    - Secondary images MUST be placed under H2 headings that come AFTER the video
    - Each secondary image should be placed under a different H2 heading
    - Never repeat the same secondary image multiple times
    - Distribute secondary images evenly across remaining H2 sections
    
    IMPORTANT CONTENT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
    - DO NOT include the title as H1 in the content - the title will be handled separately by the platform
    - Start the content directly with the Table of Contents placement marker, then the introduction
    - Use proper HTML tags: <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <table>, etc.
    - Create at least 3-4 H2 sections for proper structure with descriptive, SEO-friendly headings
    - Make sure sections flow logically and coherently
    - Include all specified keywords naturally throughout the content (especially in headings and early paragraphs)
    - Include a meta description of 155-160 characters that includes at least 2 primary keywords
    - Format the introduction paragraph special: Make the first sentence bold with <strong> tags AND add <br> after each sentence in the intro paragraph
    - DO NOT generate content that compares competitor products or prices - focus solely on the features and benefits of our products
    
    SPECIFIC MEDIA PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Under the SECOND H2 heading ONLY, add: <!-- YOUTUBE_VIDEO_PLACEMENT_MARKER -->
    - Under each subsequent H2 heading (after the video), add: <!-- SECONDARY_IMAGE_PLACEMENT_MARKER -->
    - Use unique placement markers - each secondary image will be automatically assigned to different H2 sections
    - DO NOT repeat the same secondary image placement marker multiple times
    - The system will automatically prevent duplicate images and distribute them evenly
    
    TABLE OF CONTENTS REQUIREMENTS:
    - AUTOMATICALLY include a Table of Contents at the very beginning of the content
    - Add this TOC placement marker at the start: <!-- TABLE_OF_CONTENTS_PLACEMENT -->
    - The system will automatically generate a TOC using all H2 headings in your content
    - Make sure each H2 heading has a unique id attribute (e.g., <h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>)
    - Use descriptive, SEO-friendly id names based on the heading text (lowercase, hyphenated)
    - Include an id="faq" on your FAQ section if present
    - The TOC will be styled with a clean, professional appearance and will improve user navigation
    
    FAQ SECTION FORMATTING (if FAQ is enabled):
    - Format all FAQ questions with "Q:" prefix (colon, not period)
    - Format all FAQ answers with "A:" prefix (colon, not period) 
    - Use proper HTML structure: <h3>Q: Question here?</h3><p>A: Answer here.</p>
    - Make FAQ section engaging and helpful for readers
    
    IMPORTANT IMAGE AND LINK GUIDELINES:
    - NEVER include direct image URLs or links to external websites like qualitywatertreatment.com, filterwater.com, or any other retailer sites

    - DO NOT include ANY external links except to trusted reference sites like .gov, .edu, or wikipedia.org

    - Do not include any image placeholders or special markup except for the placement markers mentioned above
    - The system will handle image insertion automatically at the marked locations
